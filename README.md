# Artemis 3D

## Description

Artemis 3D is a collection of open-source tools to quickly prototype and test mobile augmented reality (AR) projects. 

**Artemis 3D Viewer** uses [Babylon.js](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js) and the [WebXR API](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr) on mobile browsers to deliver Artemis 3D projects. 

**Artemis 3D Blender** is an add-on for Blender to create Artemis 3D projects and automatically upload them to an Artemis 3D Server. It aims to be usable by non-programmers, such as artists and domain experts from cultural fields. 

**Artemis 3D Server** hosts the Artemis 3D Viewer and provides an API for uploading Artemis 3D projects.

## Main Goals

- Creating, editing and sharing Artemis 3D projects
- Providing common AR functionality as found in ARCore and ARKit
- Scripting via a visual programming interface or [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Viewing Artemis 3D projects using [Mozilla's WebXR Viewer](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/webxr-ios) on iOS or [Google Chrome Canary](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chrome.canary&hl=en) on Android
